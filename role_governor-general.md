# Governor General

The backstop/emergency-brake/deus ex machina of the [Grants Ritual](the-grants-ritual).  This is the most "organizational" sounding of roles, compared to shaper or ritual writer, and that's intentional.  This role is reminding us that the grant process is soemthiong that connects us to a larger world body(the one giving us the grant).  It is not just a thing we pull from the ether, but a way we are interpreting and shaping an admininstrative act.

For our current grant, Dominic is ultimately the point of contact (and contract) with Dfinity. As a representative of that relationship, he has the right to dissolve the current grant process if he does not have faith in the current process.  This power is to protect him and his relationship with this Dfinity, and also a last resort safety mechanism to protect the community.

_The title for this position is taken from New Zealand government. We have literally this role which has this power over parliament. It's a power that's never been executed in my lifetime._

The Governor General is also the payout clerk, the one who grabs the [Chosen Adventurers'](role_chosen-adventurers) details and makes sure they get paid.
