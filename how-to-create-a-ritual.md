# How to Create a Ritual

A Ritual is made up of the following Parts:

**Intention**
The reason for the ritual, the world or feeling or moment you would like to reach.

**Participants** 
Who would be needed for this ritual.  These folks can be given whatever name you'd like, and can be seen as the "roles" necessary for the ritual to be performed successfully.  The crucial aspect of this is that while roles are needed, they do not have to be filled by the same person each time.  Rather, a person can volunteer for this role for the length of the ritual and no longer.  If participants require certain qualities (experience with scuttlebutt, development ability, being the 7th daughter of a 7th son, etc) then clarify as such in the role definition.

**Time**

When the ritual should take place and for how long it should take place.  It is best to give a general description of time (the first of the month, upon the rise of the harvest moon, when a new client is announced, a saturn retrograde, etc) rather than a specific date.

**Materials**

The things required for the ritual to be successful.  This can be a mixture of digital and material tools, or even ephemeral,metaphysical feelings.  Examples could include certain documents, a group call, a git repo, the queen of swords, a hackmd page, a ticktack blog post, or selenite.  Some of these pieces may be reusable across other rituals. If some material has use for multiple rituals, and is known by itself within our community, then it's become a "Charmed Object".   As such, you'll wnat to give this charmed object a name, and a definition on it's own page.

**The Ritual**

A step by step process for the ritual.  Write this up so the ritual can be performed without:
- you being present to guide it
- Someone who knows you being present instead.

Rather, ritual instructions should be clear enough that any Scuttler can follow and manifest their own version. What exactly this means is up to you!
