# Background

Liz is a writer, musician, zinester, and community gardener living in New York.  She is a member of the Silent Barn collective, and helps run the incredible DIY venue Silent Barn.  It was there that I initially met her, at a show where her band Lizzyton 2000 played.  She also helps run the e-zine ['The Media'](http://fvckthemedia.com), which is an incredible source of news, reviews, help, and politics for the extended music community.

I wanted to talk to her, however, because of a series of articles she wrote about streaming and how technology is affecting the indepdendent music community.  I would urge all of y'all to read these, as they're articulate, well-researched, and have a necessary big-view into how spotify nad other music tech is directly hurting the independent scene.  I love these articles so much I'ma just list them here for you to read and then come back:

Sweet, you're back!  And so I was, obviously, interested in Liz' views on the _future_ of independent music.  I didn't want to talk about why the current models were bad, or how we could make a better alternative to spotify.  I wanted to speak far more generally and optimistically: in our optimistic future, how does technology augment a healthy music scene?  And so we met at Molasses Books this Monday to discuss!

# The Discussion

## What makes up a Scene
My first question was, "What makes up a healthy music community? What parts are needed?"  She quickly answered with a far lengthier list than I was expecting, which was:

* Spaces to gather and perform that are accessible and participatory.
* Instruments, or access to instruments (she brought up Girls Rock Camp as a great example of this, as it puts insturments in the hands of people who didn't know they _could_ be in a band.)
* Encouragement
* Community
* Accessible, affordable ways to record music, or support the recording.
* Ways to release this music and discover it(e.g. cheap cassette tape makers)
* Artists to make the album art, show flyers, and other assets.
* Zines, blogs, websites that report upon and advocate for the scene and its music.
* bookers connected in an underground network, to help plan out shows in your community and larger tours.
* Educational resources for how the music industry works.
* People knowing that music is something they can make in their life.

She voiced surprise at how long and varied of a list it ended up being.  She was speaking off the top of her head, and created a web of people all involved and necessary for punk rock.  I noticed that she didn't mention fans.  She said that Enthusiastic fans are important, of course, but they are inherent in all the thigns listed above because DIY is participatory.  Every above role is also a fan, but who wants to be a part of it in some way.  Even folks who are "just" enthusiastic fans and supporters of a scene end up helping with message boards, or starting their own zines, or bands.  While the term DIY has become hollowed out (much like the terms indie and punk before) at it's heart it stands for accessibility and participatory.  An independent music community offers you the ability to be more than a spectator.  So something like Silent Barn isn't just a diy space; a better descriptor would be a _collaboratively run space_.

## How would technology support the scene?

This is an idea we returned to throughout the conversation, but an encapsulation would be that technology should be:
* modular
* encouraging of creativity
* accessible to anyone
* non-commercial 
* supportive and encouraging the offline, material world. 

The best example of tech today that works for independent artists is [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com).  You can use bandcamp in a variety of ways, based on your need.  You can set your own prices, and the royalty system is transparent. Not only that, independent artists can actually make money from Bandcamp in a tangible way, something that is far harder through streaming services.

She thinks the best tools would be modular--that you don't have to give everything over to a single service, but can isntead have a set of tools to use as you want.  This was the promise of the early internet, she felt, but the promise is not where we are at today.  Everything is far more homogenous.  

What would help artists more is really just basic coding abilities--or different ways to learn the technical stuff, and help one another with it.  There's already so many great tools out there (like those offered by Cash Music), but the artists feel they don't have time to use it, or the mental ability.  In addition, much of the language in coding or tech tutorials is not accessible to an artist--in ways that often feel intentional.

Liz thought it was unfortunate that artists aren't using and coding their own tools, because that feels like such a part of the diy scene.  Or rather: the _way_ you release work is a _part_ of the work.  It's not just about content, but the process in which that content was created and distributed.  This should be more a part of the coonversation, but it gets blotted out by streaming platforms.

## How does Technology hamper a musician or label?

The word that came to mind was "prescriptive".  So many music platforms are prescriptive--telling you how to release and format your music, how to tag it, how to distribute it and decidinng how a fan should interact with it.  This model is at odds with an artist's own creativity, and the platforms themselves seem at odds with the interests of independent artists.

Spotify works well for mainstream, top 40 artists and they should have that platform! But indepedent musicians need something else. 

DIY labels would likely try out something new, if it existed, because they are happy to try anything--but there are only so many hours in the day and so the tools to switch over to something like that would need to be exciting and accessible for them.  It would also likely be smart to start really small-build a small community of musicians that are being helped by these future tools that can help onboard their own friends.

In the meantime, it is unlikely that any independent musican or label would _stop_ using spotify because it does bring in _some_ money, and who are they to turn it down?  In addition, bands and labels don't like to criticize these streaming platforms too publicly or bluntly, as it can directly hurt them.  Or, as Liz said, "They'll be penalized."  The penalization comes in your song being taken off major playlists, which are the dominant way music is discovered and shared on these platforms.  In other words, spotify can control whether or not your music is ever heard in subtle, but critical ways.  

## How can technology help a venue?

I was curious on how technology helps or hinders a venue like Silent Barn.  Silent Barn is a show-space, cafe, artist-studio, living space, publishing house, experimental art arcade, garden, classroom, and still yet more.  It was initially tough for Liz to think of how technology helps a venue like this, since so much of it's value is offline.  She felt that technology helps promote shows, and the space, to help bring people there.  It could also help with fundraising efforts.

The promotion is tricky because much of that would happen on services like Facebook and Twitter, but neither of them are designed to support independent artists.  Facebook, for example, recently put out a change to their algorithm for how things are displayed on the feed.  They said it was so users could "focus on friends and family".  What it did was bury any post that was from an organization instead of a friend, and buried event promotions.  Buried, That is, unless you paid Facebook money to boost your post.  This was another change that doesn't affect artists or organizations with a lot of money, but buries independent labels, venues, and blogs.

Facebook and twitter is still where a lot of the conversationa around music and the scene happens, though, and the closed FB groups are still grat for that.  Liz did wish there was another way to have discussions like this, like a diy specific community to help trade tips and support and general news.  There's still great value in twitter and Facebook because of these communities.

The other way Technology could help an independent venue is through collaborative tools.  Silent Barn has a shared internal calendar, and collaborative docs, and the need for polling and decision making.  Right now, this is all done through Google.  Liz wished they were using something different.  On one hand, she wished to just not be using google.  On the other, she disliked having to do everything within one space (the term modularity came up again), and the google tools really don't fit their needs.  She had heard that Loomio could be a good tool, to which I enthusiastically agreed.

## How can technology help zines and e-zines?

Liz is not a developer, but she is not a stranger to code.  The e-zine she is a part of, [The Media](http://fvckthemedia.com) is coded entirely by hand by her and a friend.  Wheenver there is a new issue, they take their initial template, code in the new articles, and then upload it through filezilla.  

This is a practice she recommends to her friends--when they want to have better control ove rtheir music and art, she recommends they just code themselves some corner of the internet.  something that is truly theirs.  People often don't know where to start, though, or find the tutorials inaccessible or not meaningful.  

Liz purposefully did not include analytics for the Media, and so much of the feedback she gets from it is from real-life interactions.  The Media will put on Release shows and will table at zine fests and she has good interactions with people through both of these.  She also sees when people share articles through twitter and FB, and when they prompt discussions there.  Similar the the venue, much of the value of an e-zine exists off-line or in non-quantifiable ways.  Technology could help the media staff organize, though, and collaborate together.  They also use twitter and Google for much of that work, but she wishes they were using something else.

## Paying Artists

I was curious on her thoughts about getting paid for putting your music out.  I remember this was a worry when folks were discussing Ferment, and a "soundcloud alternative" on Scuttlebutt.  If the music is being distributed, how do you make sure people are actually _paying_ for that music.

Liz cited Bandcamp as a positive example again.  With Bandcamp, you can listen to music for free but have the option of paying for it (and can add it to your online collection _only_ if you pay some amount for it).  This "pay what you want" model seems to work the best for independent artists.  Not everyone pays, but enough do to make it worth it.  She brought up the writings of Damon Krukowski too, in regards to this.  Damon was in the band Galaxie 500 (and is now in Damon And Naomi) and has written multiple articles about how streaming services really don't pay artists compared to offering it up for free with the option of payment (One such article is here: https://pitchfork.com/features/oped/how-to-be-a-responsible-music-fan-in-the-age-of-streaming/).  Again, allow creativity with the artists and the art, and allow for a modular approach, and people do better.

In addition, artists don't have to choose one method.  They _could_ have all their music up on spotify, apple music, and all other platforms plus offer it on bandcamp _and_ put it on their site, hosted the tracks themselves.  Any amount of money coming in would help them.  Not enough people know of all the options though.

## Summary

Near the end of our convo, Liz came to a realization: What would be great, she said, is if each band/label/artist had a 'code friend'.  If there was someone that could help them set up their own site, and host their own music, and help them with the tools for collaborating.  She amended her initial list for what makes a music scene, saying that the coder friend is an equally useful part.  This idea made me _beeeaaaaam_.

My big takeaways were such:

The technology that would help support a music community would be accessible, non-commercial, participatory, and would value creativity and the off-line.  Musicians don't need a new platform, where they're told "thisis how you do things now, and you do everything within our umbrella."  And they don't need a platform that tries to replicate every facet of a scene but now in virtual form.  Instead, the technology should make the in-person interactions better, and make all the offline activities easier.  I also think this technology is better if it's focused on being small.  Spotify wants to be universal, which means it will help only the biggest artists because it values being the biggest.  A service that values the smaller acts will be smaller itself (in my opins).

Before this, though, what would really help an independent artist is someway to just understand their computer better.  things have moved so quickly, and they've had to adapt even quicker, that seemingly simple skills have been lost.  A better familiarity with how to put up a webpage, or what "hosting" means, or how to get the most from their computer would be incredibly empowering, and open the musician up to possiblities offered through services like Cash Music.  Also, even if an organization is super hip and cool (like Silent Barn) it still faces the same organizational challenges of some tech company or non-profit.  People need to know how to successfully collaborate and organize, but on their own terms and not the terms of google or spotify.  In other words: the future will be technical, and next up is making the technical docs relatable and accessible.
