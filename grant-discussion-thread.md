# Grant Discussion Thread

This is a thread cast at the start of the [Ritual of Grant Offering](Ritual-of-the-grant-offering).  It's purpose is to provide context and structure to our discussion on which adventurer's proposals to fund this month.

## Shape

The thread will take on a new, unique shape each month but starts from the same core post.  This post helpfully provides the boundaries and useful navigation markers for the discussion.  These markers include:

* The timeline of the discussion (when it starts, when proposals are due by, when the discussion ends)
* A link to this months's [clarity pad](clarity-pad), where newcomers can find an easier-to-parse summary of the discussion.
* Links to more information about the grant itself.

### Template

You can find a useful starting template for this initiatory post here: [Grant Discussion Thread Template](templates/grant-discussion-thread)

### Where it Lives

The thread happens entirely within the scuttleverse, easily accessible by any community member no matter which social client they're using (eg.: patchbay, patchwork, patchfoo, or ticktack)
