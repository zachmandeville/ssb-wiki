# Noted Adventurers

A role within our [Grants Ritual](the-grants-ritual). Noted adventurers are those  who submit a proposal to the next/current grant selection period.  Submitting a proposal puts you on the community radar as a person with an awesome idea that you're eager to explore, and you think this adventure could help the entire scuttleverse.  You are a dreamer who knows you have the skills to manifest this dream, and look to the community for support in refining and encouraging  it.
