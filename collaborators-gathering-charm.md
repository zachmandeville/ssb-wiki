= Contributors Gathering Charm =

An ssb-gathering, formatted in a special way, to draw people to the contributors' call. In other
words,  The gathering follows a template that we've found helps these contributor calls run real smooth.  

The gathering itself should be made on ssb, using the ssb-gathering plugin.  This is accessible in Patchwork by clicking the More option.  In patchbay, you can find it by searching /gatherings.
   
The template for the gathering can be found in this wiki here:
[[templates/collaborators-gathering-charm| Template]]
