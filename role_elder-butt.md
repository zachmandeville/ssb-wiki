# Elder Butt

An elder butt is someone who, through lived experience, has useful knowledge about SSB and it's community _and_ they want to help share this knowledge.  That knowledge could be some technical know-how, or experience with the rhythms of the community, or historical context that is missing from a discussion.  What makes an Elder Butt special is that they want to help everyone else also become elders, by sharing and empowering wherever they can.
