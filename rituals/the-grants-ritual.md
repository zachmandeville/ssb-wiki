# The Grants Ritual

## Background

The SSB ecosystem wants to expand, to become more diverse, to strengthen its roots.  And as members of this community it is easy to find ourselves inspired and wanting to create something new and wonderful for this ecosystem and community.  But creating something new that you are passionate about, and that is meant to help and inspire others, can be a v. vulnerable process.  Not only that, it is a process that can be hard to do due to time and money constraints from the broader world.

And so, when we have a pool of money, we hand it out to selected, adventurous community members to help give them the money and time to pursue this dream.   Currently, our good friend Dominic received a 200k grant and chose to distribute this to the community using the Grants ritual, and it is a ritual we are writing and refining in real time.

The ritual maintains an intentionally slow pace, and process, so that the community can be involved as much as possible and so we can nurture and protect the core intention of this ritual. 

## Intention

Provide a space for SSB Adventurers to speak their dream for where SSB can go and the path they'd take to get there.  Then, provide a space for the community to discuss these dreams, to better articulate our values and hopes, and help refine the proposal for adventure so they fit our values and current need.  Lastly, provide the funding for adventurers to go on their mission, draw out their maps of SSB's expanding world, and come back home to share this adventure with the community.

## Materials

The entire grants ritual is long, and made up of smaller rituals that make this larger one possible.  So instead of listing each material, we'll list the materials for each smaller ritual on its own page.

## The Ritual

The Ritual is made up of three parts, each of them their own ritual.  You can click on each to go to their own ritual page:

* [The Ritual of Grant Offering](/rituals/ritual-of-the-grant-offering)
* [Journey of the Grant](/rituals/journey-of-the-grant)
* [Ritual of Homecoming](/rituals/ritual-of-homecoming)

You do not need to finish the entire grant ritual before you can start another one.  This is about drawing up energy from as many sides as possible to take us to as many places as possible.
