<!--Title: The Ritual of Grant Offering -->
<!--Subtitle: bring proposals together and decide upon a grant -->
:ritual:grant:

## Intention
Create a space to discuss proposed grants for the month and then decide upon up to four to fund.  The intention of it being a ritual is to help keep this entire discussion positive, on-topic, and timely.

## Participants
* [Noted Adventurers](/roles/noted-adventurers), each with their own [adventurer's proposal](adventurers-proposal)
* [MC](/roles/mc)
* [Shaper](/roles/shaper)
* [Adjudicator](/roles/adjudicator)
* [A Consenting Community](/roles/consenting-community)

## Materials
* A [discussion thread](/grant-discussion-thread)
* Multiple [Adventurer's Proposals](/adventurers-proposal)
* A [Clarity Pad](/clarity-pad)
* Good Will
* Glasses of water and walking shoes

## Time and Duration
* This ritual happens once a month, at the start of the month, as long as there are grants to give out.
* The ritual lasts until a set date.  This date is chosen by the MC for this month's ritual.  It generally is a week from when the ritual starts.  It is important to hold fast to this date, to make sure the ritual ends and all participants can stay grounded.

## The Ritual
* **Prior to the ritual, the MC begins a new Clarity Pad, following the [template](templates/clarity-pad)**
  * This pad will be used to condense the conversation happening around the proposals into easy to read highlights and crucial points.  As such, it will be fairly empty upon its creation. 
* **The MC starts the ritual by summoning a discussion thread and setting an intention**
  * Each month has it's own thread to discuss the various adventurer's proposals and ultimately come to a decision on which adventurers are chosen this month.
  * The first and second posts in this thread are done by the MC.  The first post follows the [Summoning Thread Template](/templates/grant-discussion-thread).  The second post is a personal message from the MC, relaying some good intention they have for this month's ritual or some happy memory.  This is where that goodwill comes in, and helping set the happy, communal tone of the thread.
* **Noted Adventurers add links to their adventure proposals within the summoning thread**
  * We want to know which proposals are up for discussion this month, but each proposal will likely prompt many questions and comments.  This could make a central discussion thread hard to follow. To help, noted adventurers are encouraged to share their proposals as their own threads within the #ssbc-grants channel.  Then, a link to these threads are added to the central discussion, with a short summary of the proposal.  In this way, specific questions around how the proposal would work are kept to the relevant section, and the central summoning/discussion thread can focus on which adventures we'd like to fund.
* **Submitted proposals are added to the clarity pad, by the MC or an awesome Shaper**
  * The clarity pad is intended to help give new people literal clarity on how this month's discussion is going.  It helps focus our attention to _what_ adventures are being discussed, and where one can read more about each one.  And so, to help our discussion the MC, a shaper, or the adventurer themself will add their proposal to this clarity pad as it's introduced. 
* **The community adds comments and questions about the proposal to the thread.  In other words, they discuss the grants!**
  * As a member of the community, as you feel called to do so, put in your vote for which adventures you'd like to see funded this month.  This vote is more a colloquial thing.  You are vocalizing your support for a set of adventures.  Ultimately, the adjudicator decides which ones will get funded for the month, but they do so based on the temperature of the discussion.  And so giving forward your support helps with this.  
* **Shapers help guide and focus the conversation, and gently direct off-topic posts to their relevant threads**
  * During all our vocal support and discussions, it can be easy for the conversation to get chaotic--or for a well-meaning side comment to become a dominant, off-topic discussion.  When this happens, shapers help keep the thread on track by guiding the discussion back to the root and encouraging the side comment to be on its own thread.  They can do this however they like, keeping the central intention in mind and with ample goodwill.  
  * Anyone can be a shaper, they are not strictly defined at the beginning.  If you'd like to help keep the conversation on-topic, then you are an [awesome person](/roles/awesome-person) and we love it!  
  * That being said, it can help if you decide to be a shaper at the start of the month, or if the MC or adjudicator explicitly seek out help from their friends to be shapers.
* **The MC encourages goodwill and good vibes, bringing the conversation back to our central intentions if necessary**
  * The conversation can become heated.  People are passionate about their adventures, and money is involved which complicates things further.  The MC can help keep the conversation positive and reminding the community that this is only one month's decision, not the final decision, and to remind of our central intention in these grants.
* **The MC and Adjudicator periodically remind the thread of time-limits, and when the discussion will close**
  * As the decision time approaches, it can be helpful to remind folks of our time limits and to review the temperature of the discussion (e.g. what proposals have a lot of support, which ones seem to need a bit more refinement, etc.).  
* **On the closing date, the adjudicator decides up to four adventures to fund, and announces it far and wide**
  * Upon the set closing date, the adjudicator reviews the discussion and decides upon the four best adventures to fund this month.  They declare their decision within our discussion thread, on our clarity pad, and in it's own thread on #ssbc-grants. 
* **The MC thanks the community, and requests a successor**
  * To help close this ritual, the MC thanks the community for the (potentially) difficult discussions that were had.  The MC role should be shifting, and so they also request a successor to step forward to start the ritual next month.  The way they do so is up to the MC.
* **Everyone drinks water and goes for a walk, stepping away from these screens for a while.** 
  * This ritual can be energy-intensive.  Give some energy back to yourself through water, sunshine, and motion!
