# Summoning for the Collaborators Call

## Intention
Gather up new scuttlers who seem to contribute to the health, growth and coolness of scuttlebutt and
have them talk with [[elder-butt|Elder Butts]] who want to help them find their place here.

## Time
The summoning should take place at least 3 weeks after the previous [[the-collaborators-call|Collaborabutors' Call]].  In other words, there should be a Contributors' Call once a moon.  The
summoning should take less than one moon phase, and is finished when the contributors' call has been
scheduled and placed upon everyone's calendar.

## Participants
The summoning requires only a single [[awesome-person|Awesome Person]], in fact it works best when
done by only a single person.

The summoning is most effective if the awesome person is different from the summoner of the last
Contributors' Call.

## Materials
* A friendly post in #new-people
* A [[collaborators-gathering-charm| Contributors Gathering Charm]]
* A doodle poll ( :todo: add doodle poll link)
* [[mnemosynes-hackpad| Mnemosyne's Hackpad]]
* Some type of fruit.
