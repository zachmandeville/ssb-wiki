# The Collaborators' Call

For this to work, you must have first done a [[summoning-ritual| Summoning Ritual]] to bring the
collaborators to this call.  Specifically, you would want to do the [[summoning-for-the-collaborators-call]]

##  Intention
To gather [[awesome-person| awesome people]] and [[elder-butt|elder butts]] together and learn about what's new in the scuttleverse, what awesome things people are working on, and what areas they need help with.  If a new person has joined, and is madly excited about Scuttlebutt and want to know how to help (but may not feel confident helping with the code) then a contributor's call can be a great thing to join.

## Time
These calls happen once a month, at the start of the month
