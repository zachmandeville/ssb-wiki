# Making Charmed Objects

If you find there is a certain material that could be reused in multiple ceremonies, or has additional details and context you'd like to add that don't fit within a ritual's page, then consider making it a charmed object!  

Charmed objects are simply named materials whose shape and purpose can be used in multiple rituals and whose power is known to the community.  They are often a central piece, or source of power, for a ritual.


## How to Make a Charmed Object

1. **Give your object a name**
   Give some charming and meaningful name to this object.  It doesn't have to be overly fancy, just memorable!

_Example: I would like to have a page that collected all the useful tips around scuttlebutt, and think this page could be useful for future rituals.  And so, I give it the name [[the-tapestry-of-tips|The Tapestry of Tips]]_

2. **Give your object a shape**
   Think of how this object should look, and provide a basic shape that others can follow and build from.
	* *Example: I can describe the tapestry of tips, but it'd be easier to just show wha tI mean and so I start up a document that could be a useful skeleton.  I include a couple tips so folks have good examples of what works well in the tapestry.
3. Give your object a home
   If you would like others to further charm this object with you, then you want to have an easy way for them to find it.  In other words, some link to give out so they know the exact place to look.
   	* _Example: I save the tapestry of tips as an html file, hosted online and living on git-ssb.  in this way, I can give the short URL (or dat link) for people to find it, and they can add to it by making pull requests to the repo.  
4. Tell us about this Object
   You can make a wiki page for this object here, that includes it's name, story, and home.  Below is a Useful Template.  You can also check out [[the-tapestry-of-tips|The Tapestry of Tips]]
