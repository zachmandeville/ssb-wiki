# Template: Mnemosyne's Hack for the Collaborator's Call

_These are the notes, written on a hackmd.io document, to help with [[the-collaborators-call]].  It is a starting guide, but feel free to change it as you see fit.

We like keeping notes on <http://hackmd.io>.  Once the doc is ready, the link to it should be added to your contributor's call [[gathering]]
