Name:
The {{Name of Month}} Contributors' Call!

Banner Image::
It should start with some banner art.  The art should be a favorite piece of Moebius' or other well-loved sci-fi comic artist.*

## Description

It is time for our next contributors' call!  This is a 60-90 minute call where new and old scuttlers get a chance to introduce themselves, and share a little of their aspirations and current passions.

This isn't going to be a call for deep problem solving, but I expect we'll surface some conversations we might like to continue on ssb (or another specialised call).

**Location: mumble**

Install mumble at least 15 minutes before the call, and use headphones.

Mumble Config for this Call:

```
configure it to push-to-talk mode
Address: celehner.com
Port: 64738
```
**Time: TBD**
The call will happen {{Next Week}}, but we are still determining the exact time.

We've started a doodle poll so everyone can vote on their preferred time.  **The Poll will close on {{date 3 days from now}}**:
{{Doodle Poll you've made!}}

**Notes**

A hackmd for the call is open here.  This will be our meeting minutes, and will have useful followup links:
{{hackmd.io URL.  A new one is made for each call.}}

information_source - the gathering time displayed is in your timezone (e.g. 9am Monday NZT for me)

**Wanna Help?**

During the call, we'll need someone to help keep notes on the above hackmd.  If you want to be this awesome person, let me know in the comments!

{{When a note-taker is found, you can remove this part from the gathering description!}}
