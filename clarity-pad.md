# Clarity Pad

This is a collaborative document (most often a HackMD) that summarizes the current grant dicussion/decision, to make it easier for folks to parse the [grant discussion thread](/grant-discussion-thread).  Since that thread is intended to be a lively conversation, it can be hard for newcomers (or even the current conversationalists) to understand where we are or what we're talking about.  That's where the clarity pad comes in!

## Shape

This is a collaborative document, and so should be online and editable by anyone in the community w/ little process needed.  [Hackmd.io](https://hackmd.io) is a great choice for this, and has been what we've used so far.

The Clarity pad includes the following:

- The intention of the grant
- The deadlines (for submission and decision)
- Who has submitted proposals so far (including proposals offered, but not chosen, in the past that are still relevant)
- Links to each proposal's thread
- Links to the discussion thread
- Our ultimate decision, when ready

Anyone can add or refine this, and it will act as a sort of summary for each month--and so relevant talking points for why one grant was chosen and another was not could be helpful.

### Template

There is a template available for this pad here: [Template: Clarity Pad](/templates/clarity-pad)


## Where it Lives

It usually lives on [hackmd.io](https://hackmd.io) or some similarly accessible, collaborative place.  Links to this pad are included in our discussion thread as well.
