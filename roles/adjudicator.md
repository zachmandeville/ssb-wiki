# Adjudicator

In the [Grant Ritual](the-grants-ritual), the adjudicator is the person making the final decision on which grants are funded. They fold in all of the feedback and opinions from grant discource, perhaps asking clarifying questions.  

This is not a static role.  People will maintain it for multiple rounds before passing the role onto someone else.
