# Ritual Writer

Those who dream up and describe  the rituals we go through for these SSB needs.   There's a mixture of both working with the group to figure out the best process for a practical matter, and drawing out the mysterious core of _why_ this thing matters.  They then create or refine a ritual to empower and charge that core need through a process others can follow.  While rituals will start usually with some particular need or question, they are written to be general enough that others can find inspiration and become ritual writers themselves.
