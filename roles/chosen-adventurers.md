# Chosen Adventurers

For the [Grants Ritual](the-grants-ritual), These are [noted adventurers](roles/noted-adventurers) who are chosen to carry out their quests this month.  

"This month" is important: if a proposal is not chosen, it doesn't mean it was bad or unnecessary.  It likely means that it may be more useful (or better supported) when this month's chosen proposals are done first; and so the proposal rolls over to the next month to see if that's a better time.  Or, it means the adventurer has an awesome idea, but they haven't fully fleshed out the map to get there. In this case, not being chosen is an opportunity to better refine and communicate their map.
