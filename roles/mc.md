# Role: MC - The Master of Ceremonies


This person gets the ball rolling and keeps it rolling with our larger processes in rituals.  

For example, with the [Grant Ritual](/rituals/the-grants-ritual), They do things like start the thread which invites grants, remind people of what it means, and progress the process to the next stage. 

The final role of the MC is to pass the microphone to the next MC for the following month/ritual/process.  This can be a recurring responsibility of a person, if they wish, but it should not be a static position.
