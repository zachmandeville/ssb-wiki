# Shaper

The people who give actionable, specific, and kind feedback when someone is not understanding, or choosing not to follow, the agreed space of our ritual or some other process.  The shapers help guide the community and the ritual at hand so it's clear to everyone and moves as quickly as it should.  There will ideally be many people in this role, but at least one person should state they wanna take on this role each time a ritual occurs in which a shaper is needed (e.g.: they are huge for our [Grants Ritual](the-grants-ritual).

Here's an example of a shaper activity, from the grant process:

If an argument/discussiona rises in the context of the main Grant decision thread, then the shaper should promptly move the conversation into another thread, to avoid delaying the deliberations process.  A shaper, then, would notice when such a discussion is starting to form, and direct it to its own thread--with an explanation to the rest of the group for _why_ we do this.
