# A Consenting Community

When a ritual is being enacted that affects the larger community (e.g. the [Grants Ritual](the-grants-ritual), where money is being given to chosen members of the community)-- then the community needs to actually consent to this ritual and it's affects.

Community will have different defnitions depending on the ritual/need/world-- but it's important that it is defined within a ritual.
