# Charmed Object: Adventurer's Proposal

The proposal is used during our [Grants Ritual](/rituals/the-grants-ritual) to better give shape to the adventure you would like to go on, and the treasures you think you could bring back. With the initial proposal, the community can help refine this sketch and see if it fits with the ecosystem's needs at this moment.  If the desire matches the need, then the Proposal is funded through a grant.

## The Shape of a Proposal

The proposal seeks to answer these three questions:

* What are you going to do? (does it relate to what we want more of?)
* How are you going to spread your 1 month of work?
* why are you motivated to do this?

The proposal you write should not be considered a final, unchangeable thing.  We encourage each other to share early, and get feedback to better shape your dream. Think of your initial proposal as like a dream of a land just beyond the borders of what we know.  You share this dream and correlate it with what the community knows, to start to build a map of this place.  The final proposal,then,  would be a rough map of what we think this place would look like, how you think you could  get there, and a list of supplies for your adventure.  We do not expect it to be entirely mapped yet (otherwise, the adventure wouldn't be necessary), but the path should feel do-able.

## Where it Lives
The template for a proposal lives within this wiki, accessible here: [Adventurer's Proposal Template](/templates/adventurers-proposal)

When your proposal feels ready to share, place it within the current Grant Proposal thread, which arrives once at the start of each month.  

If your proposal is not chosen this month, it does not mean it will never be chosen--only that others seemed to fit the current ability and needs of that month.  And so, you are heartily encouraged to submit it again the following month.
